# 📡 Automated Employee Attendance System using RFID

An embedded system project that automates employee attendance recording using RFID technology.

The system uses **RFID cards, dual microcontrollers, and real-time clock integration** to record employee attendance accurately and transmit data to a computer system.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Traditional attendance systems are manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors such as proxy attendance.

This project implements an **RFID-based automated attendance system** that records employee attendance quickly, securely, and efficiently.

Each employee is assigned a unique RFID card. When the card is scanned, the system records the employee ID along with the current date and time.

## 🧠 System Architecture

The system uses **two microcontrollers**:

| Microcontroller | Role |
|----------------|------|
| 8051 | RFID card reading |
| LPC2129 | Main system controller |

## 🖥 System Workflow

1. System initializes all modules.
2. LCD prompts user to **scan RFID card**.
3. RFID reader detects employee card.
4. 8051 reads RFID ID.
5. ID is sent to LPC2129.
6. LPC2129 retrieves **current date and time from RTC**.
7. Attendance record is created.
8. LCD confirms attendance.
9. Data is sent to PC terminal and stored.
